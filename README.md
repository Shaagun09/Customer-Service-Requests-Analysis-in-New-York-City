# **Customer Service Requests Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project analyzes New York City's 311 service request data to optimize response times and improve efficiency. The goal is to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and recurring spikes in complaints to enhance service delivery and customer satisfaction.

---

## **Business Question**
**How can NYC optimize its services to improve response times and efficiency in addressing various types of complaints across different locations?**

Key questions include:
- What are the major trends in service requests over time?
- Are there seasonal patterns or recurring spikes in specific types of complaints?

---

## **Objectives**
1. Analyze NYC 311 service request data to identify trends and patterns.
2. Visualize data and perform complaint type analysis.
3. Propose operational improvements to enhance service efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## **Project Plan**
### **1. Data Understanding and Preparation**
- **Dataset**: Public dataset from Kaggle (311 complaints from 2010â€“2016).
- **Features**: Complaint ID, type, resolution details, location (latitude/longitude), etc.
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Load data into Amazon S3 in JSON format.
  - Drop unnecessary features and duplicates.
  - Handle null values (e.g., fill numerical columns with the mean, drop rows where needed).
  - Convert column types to appropriate formats (e.g., date to datetime).
  - Use **Amazon Glue Data Brew** for preprocessing.

### **2. Data Modeling**
- Use **Amazon Athena** to:
  - Execute SQL queries and analyze trends in complaint types and locations.
  - Perform statistical analysis to uncover patterns.

### **3. Visualization and Deployment**
- Create interactive dashboards using **Tableau** for actionable insights.
- Deploy models and dashboards to facilitate data-driven decision-making.
